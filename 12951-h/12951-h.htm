    <blockquote>
        <p>[The eminent Author writes to us as
        follows:&mdash;"How's this for a Saga? Do you know what a
        Saga is? Nor do I, but this is one in spite of what anybody
        may say. History be blowed! Who cares about history? Mix up
        your dates and your incidents, and fill up with any amount
        of simple human passions. Then you'll get a Saga? After
        that you can write a Proem and an Epilogue. They must have
        absolutely nothing to do with the story, but you can put in
        some Northern legends, and a tale about MAHOMET (by the
        way, I've written a play about him) which are bound to
        tell, though, of course, you were not bound to tell them.
        Ha, ha! who talked about thunderstorms, and passions, and
        powers and emotions, and sulphur-mines, and heartless
        Governors, and wicked brothers? Read on, my bonny boy.
        <i>Vous m'en direz des nouvelles</i>, but don't call this a
        novel. It's a right-down regular Saga."&mdash;C.A.]</p>

    <h3>THE BOOK OF STIFFUN ORRORS.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

        </a>The Characters Personally-Conducted by the Author to
        Reykjavik.
    </div>

    <p>STIFFUN ORRORS was a gigantic fair-haired man, whose muscles
    were like the great gnarled round heads of a beech-tree. When a
    man possesses that particular shape of muscle he is sure to be
    a hard nut to crack. And so poor PATRICKSEN found him, merely
    getting his own wretched back broken for his trouble. GORGON
    GORGONSEN Was Governor of Iceland, and lived at Reykjavik, the
    capital, which was not only little and hungry, but was also a
    creeping settlement with a face turned to America. It was a
    poor lame place, with its wooden feet in the sea. Altogether a
    strange capital. In the month of Althing GORGON took his
    daughter to Thingummy-vellir, where there were wrestling
    matches. It came to the turn of PATRICKSEN and STIFFUN. STIFFUN
    took him with one arm; then, curling one leg round his head and
    winding the other round his waist, he planted his head in his
    chest, and crushing his ribs with one hand he gave a mighty
    heave, and clasping the ground, as with the hoofs of an ox, he
    flung him some two hundred yards away, and went and married
    RACHEL the Governor's daughter. That night he broke
    PATRICKSEN's back, as if he had been a stick of sugar-candy.
    After this he took his wife home, and often beat her, or set
    his mother on her. But one day she happened to mention
    PATRICKSEN, so he fled, cowed, humiliated, cap in hand, to
    Manxland, but left to her her child, her liberator, her FASON,
    so that she might span her little world of shame and pain on
    the bridge of Hope's own rainbow. She did this every day, and
    no one in all Iceland, rugged, hungry, cold Iceland, knew how
    she did it. It was a pretty trick.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>This is the Isle of Man, the island of MATT MYLCHREEST, and
    NARY CROWE, but plenty of vultures, the island of Deemsters,
    and Keys, and Kirk Maughold, and Port y Vullin. Here at the
    Lague lived ADAM FATSISTER, the Deputy Governor, who had been
    selected for that post because he owned five hundred hungry
    acres, six hungrier sons, a face like an angel's in homespun, a
    flaccid figure, and a shrewd-faced wife, named RUTH. Hither
    came STIFFUN, to beg shelter. The footman opened the door to
    him, but would have closed it had not ADAM, with a lusty old
    oath, bidden him to let the man in. Hereupon STIFFUN's face
    softened, and the footman's dropped; but ORRORS, with an
    Icelander's inborn courtesy, picked it up, dusted it, and
    returned it to its owner. Shortly afterwards, STIFFUN became a
    bigamist and a wrecker, and had another son, whom, in honour of
    the Manxland Parliament, he christened MICHAEL MOONKEYS, and
    left him to be cared for by old ADAM, whose daughter's name was
    GREEBA. STIFFUN, as I have said, was a wrecker, a wrecker on
    strictly Homeric principles, but a wrecker, nevertheless. When
    storm-winds blew, he was a pitcher and tosser on the ocean,
    but, like other pitchers, he went to the bad once too often,
    and got broken on the rocks. Then came KANE WADE, and CHALSE,
    and MYLCHREEST, and they sang hymns to him.</p>

    <p>"Ye've not lived a right life," said one. "Now, by me sowl,
    ye've got to die," sang another. "All flesh is as grass,"
    roared a third. Suddenly FASON stood beside his bedside.
    "This," he thought, "is my father. I must kill him." But he
    restrained himself by a superhuman effort&mdash;and that was
    the end of ORRORS.</p>

    <h3>THE BOOK OF MICHAEL MOONKEYS.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>MICHAEL and FASON were both the sons of ORRORS. They were
    both Homeric, and both fell in love with GREEBA, who flirted
    outrageously with both. These coincidences are absolutely
    essential in a tale of simple human passions. But, to be short,
    GREEBA married MICHAEL, who had become First President of the
    second Icelandic Republic. Thus GREEBA and MICHAEL were at
    Reykjavik. FASON followed, spurred by a blind feeling of
    revenge. About this time Mrs. FATSISTER took a dislike to her
    husband.</p>

    <p>"Crinkum, crankum!" she said, "you'd have me toil and moil
    while you pat your nose at the fire."</p>

    <p>"RUTH," said ADAM.</p>

    <p>"Hoity toity!" cried she. "The house is mine. Away with
    you!" So poor old ADAM also set out for Reykjavik, and the
    boatmen cried after him, "<i>Dy banne jee oo</i>!" and he
    immediately jeeooed, as you shall hear. Last, GREEBA's six
    brothers packed up, and left for Reykjavik; and now that we
    have got all our characters safely there, or on the way, we can
    get on with the story. It may be mentioned, however, that Mrs.
    ADAM found a fever in a neglected cattle-trough. Being a
    grasping woman, she caught it, and took it home&mdash;and it
    killed her.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>RED FASON meant to kill MICHAEL. That was plain. So he was
    tried by a Bishop and nine of his neighbours an hour or so
    after the attempt. And although the time was so short, all the
    witnesses had been collected, and all formalities completed.
    And FASON was dumb, but great of heart, and the Bishop
    condemned him to the sulphur-mines, for which he soon
    afterwards started with his long stride, and his shorn head,
    and his pallid face. Upon this the six brothers of GREEBA
    arrived, spread calumnies, and were believed. Their names were
    ASHER, JACOB, JOHN, THURSTAN, STEAN, and ROSS, but they
    preferred addressing one another as JOBBERNOWL, WASTREL,
    GOMERSTANG, BLUBBERHEAD, NUMSKULL, and BLATHERSKITE. It saved
    time, and made things pleasant all round. MICHAEL quarrelled
    with his wife, and there is no knowing what might have
    happened, if GORGON GORGONSEN, at the head of some Danish
    soldiers, had not upset the Republic, and banished MICHAEL to
    the sulphur-mines to join his brother.</p>

    <h3>THE BOOK OF RED FASON.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

    <p>Poor ADAM arrived too late, yet he has his use in the tale,
    for his words to GORGON GORGONSEN were bitter words, such as
    the cruel old Governor liked not. And he harried him, and
    worried him, but without avail, for in Reykjavik money was
    justice, and ADAM had spent his. What availed it that a grey
    silt should come up out of the deposits of his memory? That was
    a totally unmarketable commodity in Reykjavik, as ADAM found to
    his cost. And in the end intending to shoot MICHAEL they shot
    FASON. And yet it is perfectly certain that the next chapter of
    this Saga, had there been a next, would have found all the
    characters once more in the Isle of Man. For nothing is more
    surely established than this: that a good (or a bad) Icelander,
    when he dies (or lives), goes always to the Isle of Man, and
    every self-respecting Manxman returns the compliment by going
    to Iceland. And thus are Sagas constructed. And this is the
    End.</p>

    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Enter</i> LAUNCE <i>with his dog</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Launce</i>. When a poor man's cur shall cost him some
    thirteen shillings and sixpence within the year, look you, it
    goes hard; one that I brought up as a puppy; one of a mongrel
    litter that I saved from drowning, when three or four of his
    blind, breedless brothers and sisters went to it. Verily I will
    write to the <i>Standard</i> thereanent. Item&mdash;muzzle, two
    shillings; item&mdash;collar, under new order, two shillings
    and sixpence; item&mdash;engraving collar, under new order, one
    shilling and sixpence; item&mdash;licence, seven shillings and
    sixpence; total, thirteen shillings and sixpence, as aforesaid.
    Truly a poor man feeleth an amount like this, and hath to deny
    himself some necessary to preserve his affectionate companion,
    to wit, his dog. I have taught him, even as one would say,
    precisely, "thus would I teach a dog." O 'tis a foul thing when
    a dog cannot keep himself in all companies, but must grub for
    garbage in the gutter, and yap at constables' kibes! I would
    have, as one should say, one that takes upon himself to be a
    dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. And art
    thou so, <i>Crab</i>? But verily 'tis I who have taught thee,
    that have also to pay for thee; and, whether the art wholly
    worth the cost, concerns not thee, but thy master. Thou hast of
    late many enemies in seats of office, and elsewhere; ministers,
    and scribes, and feeble folk in fidgety fear of hypothetical
    hydrophoby. "Out with the dog!" says one. "That cur looks mad!"
    says another; "Muzzle him!" says the third. "Knock me him on
    the head with a constable's staff!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> cries the fourth; "Give him
       <i>euthanasia</i> at the Dog's Home!" suggests a fifth, with
       more sensibility; "Tax him, collar him, badge him, make his
       owner pay roundly for him!" saith the Minister of
       Agriculture. And they, between them, make me no more ado
       than whip me thirteen and six out of my pinched pocket to
       pay thee out of danger. How many masters would do this for
       their servant? Nay, I'll be sworn I have paid the fines
       inflicted by austere Magistrates, when thou, <i>Crab</i>,
       hast surreptitiously slipped thy muzzle, otherwise thou
       hadst been executed; I have "tipped" angry constables when
       thou hast stolen out not "under control," otherwise thou
       hadst suffered for't: thou thinkest not of this now! Nay, I
       remember the trick thou servedst me anigh the end of the
       year, when I had so far successfully dodged the Dog Tax for
       that season: did I not bid thee still mark me, and keep out
       of sight when the rate-collector called? When didst thou see
       me rush headlong upstairs and make madly for the collector's
       calves? Didst thou ever see me do such a fool's trick?</p>

    <h2>AUDITORS IN WONDERLAND.</h2>

    <p>"If you please," said the Auditor of the Tottenham School
    Board accounts, "would you explain to me what that curious
    thing is that you have got in your hand?"</p>

    <p>"With pleasure," replied the White Knight, who had recently
    been elected as a Member of the Board. "It's a Tellurium."</p>

    <p>"I see that it cost the ratepayers four pounds to buy. What
    is the use of it?"</p>

    <p>"Use?" said the White Knight, in mild surprise. "Oh, it's a
    most useful thing. A child who can't think of the right answer
    to a question about the stars, only has to put this thing on
    its head&mdash;at Examination time, you know&mdash;and it at
    once remembers all about it. It's got Electricity or something
    inside it. And the shape is my own invention."</p>

    <p>"That's why it's called a Tellurium, then," remarked the
    Auditor, who could hardly help laughing, it all seemed so
    strange; "because, when they put it on, the children <i>tell
    you</i> the answer you want?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; and WILLIAM TELL put an apple on his head, or on
    somebody else's head, and I thought the name would remind the
    children of that fact."</p>

    <p>"Then the School must win an increased Government Grant,
    with this thing to help them," said the Auditor.</p>

    <p>"Well," said the Knight, more despondently, "they have
    hardly had time to try it yet. In fact," he added, still more
    gloomily, "their teachers won't let them try it. But it's
    really an admirable idea, if it <i>could</i> be tried." And the
    White Knight fastened the curious object on his own head,
    whence it immediately fell with a crash upon the floor.</p>

    <p>"It's too ridiculous!" exclaimed the Auditor, bursting into
    a little laugh. "I declare a Hektograph would be as useful for
    the children as this thing!"</p>

    <p>"Would it?" asked the White Knight. "Does a Hektograph work
    well? Then we'll get one or two&mdash;several."</p>

    <p>"And I notice," the Auditor went on, "that there is a thing
    called a Cyclostyle put down in the accounts. Please will you
    tell me what a Cyclostyle is, and what use it is for purposes
    of elementary education?"</p>

    <p>"With pleasure," replied the White Knight, who seemed quite
    cheerful again; "it's an apparatus for catching cycles, if any
    should take to going round and round the room when the children
    are at their lessons. It does it <i>in style</i>, you see."</p>

    <p>"But," said the Auditor, "it's not very likely that any
    cyclists would care to wheel their machines into a Board
    School, is it?"</p>

    <p>"Not very <i>likely</i>, I daresay," the Knight answered,
    eagerly; "but, if any <i>do</i> come, I don't intend that we
    shall be without a machine for catching them quickly. And the
    plan is my own invention!"</p>

    <p>"I should suppose it was," the Auditor observed. "I am sorry
    to be obliged to disallow the costs of all these inventions,
    but the ratepayers must not he forced to pay for fads; and, as
    you take such an interest in them, I am sure you won't mind,
    paying for them yourself. Good-day!"</p>

    <p>Pantomime! Pantomime!! The only DRURIOLANUS, and the only
    Pantomime in the Tame West. Therefore, it is almost a duty, let
    alone a pleasure, on the part of Parents and Guardians to take
    the young gentlemen from school, schools public and private,
    and the young ladies freed awhile from their Governesses, to
    see <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> at Drury Lane. "Is it a good
    Pantomime this year?" "<i>That</i>," as <i>Hamlet</i> once
    observed, though at that particular moment he was not thinking
    of Pantomimes, nor even of his own capital little drawing-room
    drama for distinguished amateurs, entitled <i>The
    Mousetrap</i>, "<i>that</i> is the question." And <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> First Commissioner of Theatres can conscientiously
    answer, "Yes, a decidedly good Pantomime." If pressed farther
    by those who "want to know" as to whether it's <i>the best</i>
    Pantomime he ever saw, the First Commissioner answers, "No, it
    is not <i>Beauty and the Best</i>," and he is of opinion that
    he must travel, in a train of thought on the line of Memory,
    back to the PAYNES and the VOKESES in the primest of their
    prime, if he would recall two or three of the very best, mind
    you, <i>the very best</i>, Pantomimes ever seen in the Tame
    West. For real good rollicking fun, the Pantomimes at the
    Surrey and the Grecian used to be worth the trouble of a
    pilgrimage; but it was a trouble, for the show used to commence
    early and end late, and indigestion was the consequence of a
    disturbed dinner and the unaccustomed heartiness of a most
    enjoyable supper.</p>

    <p>Drury Lane Pantomime commences at 7.30, and is not over till
    11.30, and yet in these four hours there rarely comes over you
    any sense of weariness, except perhaps when the ballets are too
    long. From first to last the audience is expecting something,
    and is ready to accept every transition from one scene to
    another as a change for the better. Mr. HARRY NICHOLLS and Mr.
    HERBERT CAMPBELL are, of course, funny to look at as the
    conventional proud sisters; only, as they admit in one of their
    duets, "it's been done before," in <i>Cinderella</i>, for
    example; and, by the way, in choosing this subject of <i>Beauty
    and the Beast</i>, all resemblance between the two stories
    should have been got rid of, as, up to the Ball Scene, except
    for the absence of the Pumpkin and the Mice, it is difficult to
    distinguish between the two fairy tales. But, when last I saw
    <i>Cinderella</i>, wasn't ROSINA VOKES the sprightly heroine,
    and her brother with the wonderful legs the <i>Baron</i>? I
    think so: but I will not be too much of a <i>laudator temporis
    acti</i>, and will be thankful that one of the youthful
    Commissioners thoroughly enjoyed this Pantomime, though he was
    not absolutely certain as to what might be the effect of ghosts
    and skeletons on his very little brother, aged five or six, if
    he were brought to see this show. For my part, had I at an
    early age seen these skeletons which pervade the piece, and of
    whom two become elongated ghosts, I should have lain awake o'
    nights, seen horrible reproductions on the wall by the glimmer
    of the fire-light (spectral rush-lights were used when I was a
    small boy), screamed for help, and perhaps given my own private
    and practical version of the Ghost Scene in <i>Richard the
    Third</i> by <i>not</i> leaping out of bed and shouting, "Give
    me another horse!" (there was only one in the nursery, and that
    was a towel-horse), but by putting my head under the
    bed-clothes and shivering with fear till my nurse returned from
    her supper. Such on me, your present brave First Commissioner
    of Theatres, was the effect of merely seeing the interior of
    the <i>Blue Chamber</i> in <i>Skelt's Scenes and
    Characters</i>, with which I used to furnish my small theatre
    on the nursery table.</p>

    <p>Well, this is all private and personal, and not much about
    the Drury Lane Pantomime, it is true; but, as everyone will see
    "The Only Pantomime" (we have reached the era of the "Onlys"),
    and be only too delighted, what need I say more than that the
    <i>libretto</i> is written by Mr. BILL-OF-THE-PLAY YARDLEY
    conjointly with Mr. DRURIOLANUS AUCTOR, and I daresay it was
    very witty and rhythmical and poetical, though I didn't catch
    much of it, and the songs were neither particularly well sung,
    nor remarkably humorous,&mdash;one, introduced by Miss VESTA
    TILLY (and, therefore, for this our joint authors are not
    responsible, except for permitting it to be done), being a
    distinct mistake, and utterly out of character with the part of
    the <i>Prince</i>, as written, which she was representing. And,
    <i>à propos</i> of songs, the music of this Pantomime lacks
    "go." WAGNER borrowed from pantomime his notion of dramatic
    music to carry on the action and tell the story of serious
    opera; but we don't want our Pantomimes to become Wagnerian;
    or, at all events, as the lamented GEORGE HODDER would have
    said, "Let's have plenty of the 'Wag,' and none of the
    'nerian.'" What he would have exactly meant by this nobody
    would have known, but everyone would have laughed, as he was
    one of those self-patented jesters at whose witticisms the
    company laughed first and wondered afterwards.</p>

    <p>DRURIOLANUS MAGNUS, not content with his own special
    pantomime-pie and a Drama at Covent Garden, has had a
    finger,&mdash;only a little one, perhaps, and not the thumb,
    with which JOHANNES HORNERIUS extracted the plum,&mdash;in the
    Christmas pie at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, of which the
    Manager is HORATIUS SEDGERIUS.</p>

    <p>Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, <i>patres et matres, et</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> <i>tutores</i>, if you want
       to know what to take your little children, your bigger
       children, your boys and girls to see, and what you
       yourselves, familiar with your THACKERAY as I take you to
       be, would enjoy seeing, I say emphatically and distinctly,
       without any evasion, reservation, or mental equivocation,
       "Go and see, and take them all to see, <i>The Rose and the
       Ring</i>, written by SAVILE CLARKE, with music composed for
       it by WALTER SLAUGHTER, put on the stage by <i>Les deux
       Ajax</i> CAROLUS and AUGUSTUS HARRIS,&mdash;Christmas
       CAROLUS being <i>facile princeps</i> at this difficult
       business."</p>

    <p>There is an excellent orchestra here, playing the musical
    game of "follow my leader" to perfection, and kept together, as
    sheep, by a CROOK. Mr. HARRY MONKHOUSE is very droll in the
    little he has to do. Mr. SHALE's speech as the Court Painter is
    capitally given, but there isn't enough of it. A touch more, a
    few more good lines, and the speech, as a showman's speech,
    would have been encored. Mr. S. SOLOMON as <i>Jenkins</i>, the
    Hall Porter, is made up so as to be the very <i>fac-simile</i>
    of THACKERAY's own illustration, and to reproduce that Master's
    sketches with more or less exactitude has evidently been the
    aim of all the actors; but <i>Jenkins</i> has been peculiarly
    successful, as has also <i>Prince Bulbo</i>, of whom more anon.
    As <i>Polly</i> in Act the First, and <i>General Punchikoff</i>
    in the Second, Miss EMPSIE BOWMAN was delightful, and her elder
    sister, Miss ISA BOWMAN, made every sharp point tell, and into
    the gold, of which success the name of BOWMAN is of good omen:
    and this is almost a rhyme. The part of <i>Prince Giglis</i>,
    in the absence of Miss VIOLET CAMERON, was satisfactorily
    rendered by Miss FLORENCE DARLEY. Miss MAUD HOLLAND looked and
    acted prettily as the <i>Princess Angelica</i>, and Madame
    AMADI was quite Thackerayan in her make-up as <i>Countess
    Gruffanuff</i>. Miss ATTALIE CLAIRE entered fully into the
    spirit of the merry piece; her rendering of a song with the
    refrain "Ah! well-a-day!" being deservedly encored.</p>

    <p>I must not forget, indeed, I cannot forget, Mr. LE HAY as
    <i>Bulbo</i>, who, not only on account of his make-up being an
    exact reproduction of THACKERAY's sketch, gave us as good a
    grotesque performance as I've seen for some considerable time.
    To see him on the ground after the fight, tearing his hair out
    in handfulls, is something that will shake the sides of the
    most sedate or <i>blasé</i>, and among the audience that will
    crowd to see this juvenile show, there will be very few sedate
    (I hope) and still fewer (I am sure) <i>blasé</i>. It is an
    excellent performance throughout. But, my dear Mr. CAROLUS
    HARRIS, one word,&mdash;when you had that capitally-arranged
    and highly effective scene of <i>Bulbo</i> going to be
    beheaded, why did you not carry it a bit further, and make
    <i>Bulbo</i> on the point of kneeling down, and the burlesque
    axe poised in the air, and <i>then</i>, but not till
    <i>then</i>, the moment which, like the present winter, is
    "critical,"&mdash;<i>then</i>, I say, enter the <i>Princess</i>
    with the reprieve? As it is, the effect of this dramatically
    grouped scene is lessened by the absence of action, and
    <i>Bulbo</i> is off the scaffold ere the majority of the
    audience realise the peril in which his life has been
    placed.</p>

    <p>I must not forget the army of children appearing from time
    to time as courtiers, cooks, fairies, soldiers, who will be the
    source of the greatest pleasure to children of all ages, from
    "little Trots" upwards. Nothing in this genuinely Christmas
    Piece is there which can do aught but delight and amuse the
    young people for whom primarily it was written. Let "all
    concerned in this" excellent piece of Christmas merriment
    accept the congratulations and best wishes for crowded
    houses&mdash;which they are sure to be for all the
    <i>Matinées</i>&mdash;from theirs truly, MR. P.'S FIRST

    <p>I tried <i>Criss-Cross Lovers</i> the other day, a Novel, in
    two or three vols., I don't remember which; but those may
    ascertain who are not choked off in the first hundred pages, as
    was the unfortunate Baron de B.-W. He had the presence of mind
    to put it down in time, and, after a few moments of refreshing
    repose, was, like <i>Richard</i>, "himself again," and able to
    tackle quite another novel.</p>

    <p>In the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>, for this month,
    I have just read a most interesting account of a visit paid by
    the Very Rev. Dean of Gloucester to the Trappist Monastery of
    La Grande Chartreuse, which, thanks to the marvellous spirit of
    the Order known as Chartreuse Verte or Chartreuse Jaune, is one
    of the Religious Confraternities not suppressed by the
    Anti-monkical majority in the French Government. The
    Baron&mdash;the umble individual who now addresses
    you&mdash;has himself entered within these Monastic walls,
    inspected the buildings, seen all the monastic practical jokes,
    known as "regular cells," and has come away the better for the
    visit, with much food for reflection and refection <i>en
    route</i> in the <i>voiture</i>, and with spirituous comfort in
    green and yellow bottles. This paper, in the <i>New
    Illustrated</i>, is well worth reading.</p>

    <p>The Baron has for some weeks had on his table, <i>Golden
    Lines; The Story of a Woman's Courage</i>, by FREDERICK WICKS.
    The Baron being, as he is bound to admit, almost human, was
    warned off the book by its title, which seems to suggest
    something in the tract line. The Publishers' name (BLACKWOOD)
    is, however, an invariable stamp of good metal. So the Baron
    picked up the book, was attracted by the remarkably clever
    illustrations, and finally, beginning at the beginning, he read
    to the end. It is a novel, and one of the best published this
    season; and all the better for being in one stout
    handsomely-printed volume. The plot is constructed with rare
    skill, the writing is good, and the people all alive. If it is
    WICKS's first work (and the Baron never heard of FREDERICK
    before) he should go on making candles of the same kind. Their
    illuminating power is rare.</p>

    <p>"<i>What shall we play at, and how shall we play it</i>?"
    The satisfactory answer to these two questions, specially
    important at Christmas time, will be found in Professor
    HOFFMANN's <i>Encyclopædia of Card and Table Games</i>,
    published by ROUTLEDGE. Here you will learn the mysteries of
    "Go-Bang," "Reverse,"&mdash;and after learning the latter, you,
    if Nature has blessed you with a tuneful voice, will be able to
    sing with GEORGE GROSSMITH (if he'll let you), "<i>See me
    Reverse</i>." The motto for the Professor's book should have
    been the emphatic exclamation of the street Arab, "My heye!
    such games!"</p>

    <p>This is the sixth year of <i>Hazell's Annual</i>. Whatever
    information you require it will be difficult not to find in
    <i>Hazell</i>, clearly and not at all Hazelly expressed. A
    youthful friend whose pun, says the Baron, I hereby nail to the
    counter, on seeing this book on my desk, observed, "Yes, I'm
    nuts on HAZELL." The Baron frowned, and the youth withered
    away, as ALICE did&mdash;not the one who went to Wonderland,
    but an elder ALICE, whom our old friend "BEN BOLT"
    remembers.</p>

    <p>SAMPSON LOW, &amp; CO. publish "<i>Wild Life on a Tidal
    Water</i>," by P.H. EMERSON, who gives the adventures of a
    house-boat and her crew on Breydon Water in Norfolk; the
    photo-etchings are by EMERSON and GOODALL, "and therefore,"
    says the Baron, "All-good."</p>

    <p>Look into <i>Harper's</i> for January; among the harpers,
    listen to M. DE BLOWITZ harping on the journalistic
    string&mdash;good; and, his talent having served him to a
    pretty tune, 'tis well he should harp on it in <i>Harper's</i>.
    The Baron hopes that M. DE B. has spent a Harpy Christmas.
    Allow the B. DE B.-W. to draw his friends' attention to "A
    Military Incident," and two other short papers, in <i>The
    Cornhill</i>. BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;The Baron says he is not going to be let in for a
    disquisition on the merits of various Pocket-books; but, if
    asked which he affectionates most as a genuine book of pockets,
    and <i>for</i> pockets, he puts his finger to the side of his
    nose, and wisely replies&mdash;"Walker."</p>

    <p>We are looking forward to <i>Ivanhoe</i>, by Sir ARTHUR S.
    SULLIVAN, Mus. Doc. From what our Musical Critic has seen of
    the score, he is able to wink his eye wisely but not too well,
    and to hint that as <i>Mr. Guppy</i> says, "There are chords";
    and to make these chords in combination, the strings are
    admirably fitted. There is one chord (will it be recognised as
    belonging to <i>Box</i>?) which&mdash; But, as Sir ARTHUR says,
    "Where will be the surprise, if your Musical Critic tells
    everything beforehand?" He is right, quite right, and, thank
    goodness, he is quite well, and not

    in a first class railway carriage ought to do if a Lady insists
    on thrusting herself upon them. <i>Truth</i> says, let her
    stand, unless she has been invited, and adds, that anyhow she,
    as an extra person, is a nuisance. <i>Mr. Punch</i> agrees with
    a difference, and says that the uninvited intruder who becomes

    <h2>LOST IN THE MIST OF AGES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Extracts from a Critique on an Exhibition to succeed
    the Guelphian, in</i> 19&mdash;.)</h4>

    <p><i>No</i>. 76. <i>Portrait of a Warrior</i>. This picture is
    described in the Catalogue as the Duke of WELLINGTON, who, it
    will be remembered, won, in the early part of the last century,
    the Battle of Waterloo, and invented a new kind of boots. The
    face is adorned with long black whiskers and moustaches, and an
    eyeglass not unlike the traditional portrait of the great W.E.
    GLADSTONE, Second Earl of BEACONSFIELD, as depicted by a now
    nearly forgotten artist, called DUNDREARY SOTHERN, or SOTHERN
    DUNDREARY. The Duke (if, indeed, it be the Duke) is wearing the
    uniform of the 3rd Middlesex Artillery Volunteers, a corps that
    was raised some ten years after His Grace's death, a fact that
    would argue that the painting was either a posthumous work, or
    intended to represent someone else. Accepting the alternative
    suggestion, the picture may hand down to posterity the features
    of BURDETT COUTTS (husband of the Baroness of that name), J.L.
    TOOLE, the popular Comedian, HENRY IRVING (his friend), the
    Rev. C.H. SPURGEON, or (and this is the most likely hypothesis)
    PRINCE GEORGE of Wales.</p>

    <p>No. 102. <i>Miniature of a Lady Unknown</i>. It is
    impossible at this lapse of time to identify the original of
    this portrait. No doubt she belonged to a short-lived and
    somewhat degraded class known as "professional beauties." In
    one hand she holds an instrument called an opera-glass, which
    was used in the last century at trials for murder at the Old
    Bailey. The hair she wears on her head is evidently false, and
    has been supplied from some foreign peasantry. Her hat is
    adorned with a stuffed bird, suggestive of the cruelty of her
    nature. As she holds in her other hand a book labelled, "<i>The
    Art of Nursing</i>," it may be conjectured that she is a
    frequent visitor to the Dissecting-Room, or the Accident Ward
    of a London Hospital. On the whole, perhaps, it is fortunate
    that her name has not been preserved by succeeding generations.
    She must, indeed, have been a contrast to her angelic
    descendants of the present day.</p>

    <p>No. 2478. <i>An Utensil Made of Brass</i>. This
    strange-looking object may have been used by our ancestors as a
    helmet, or perhaps as a fish-kettle. It is, perhaps, rather
    large for the first, and a little too thick for the second. The
    Catalogue describes the exhibit as "a coal-scuttle." It is
    impossible to verify this assertion, as coal is now only found
    in specimen cases at museums, and a sketch of a coal-scuttle
    has not been seen for the last fifty years. It is, however,
    interesting as suggestive of a time when the world was not
    heated by volcanic hot water.</p>

    <p><i>The Plain S.</i> How can you be so <i>selfish</i>,
    FLORRIE? You've had ever so much more practice than <i>I</i>
    have! Mr. ACKMEY, I wish you'd look at my left boot&mdash;it
    <i>will</i> go like that. Is it my ankle&mdash;or what? And
    this strap <i>is</i> hurting me so! Couldn't you loosen it, or
    take me back to the man, or something? FLORRIE can get on quite
    well alone, can't she?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. A.</i> (<i>temporising feebly</i>). Er&mdash;suppose
    I give <i>each</i> of you a hand, eh?</p>

    <p><i>The Plain S.</i> No; I can't go along fast, like you and
    LAURA. You promised to look after me, and I'm perfectly
    helpless alone!</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
